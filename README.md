# Printed Event Nostalgia Information Sheets

Did your ticket provider only offer e-tickets? Want to save on shipping costs? Printed Event Nostalgia Information Sheets has you covered!
This is a website that allows you to create and customize concert (or any event) tickets and print them right at home.

Please be aware that this website is not capable nor should it be used to generate real, commercially ready tickets!

## Getting Started

The website is built using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) so all you need to do is run

```
npm run dev
```

See the result on http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

The site is published under GitHub Pages utilizing the corresponding `gh-pages` branch.
With the proper access you can simply deploy running

```
npm run deploy
```

(Maybe one day I will setup a proper build-pipeline :D)
